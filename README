# MLAPACK

This is a fork of the [MPACK](https://github.com/nakatamaho/mplapack)
multiprecision linear algebra package.

The only difference to its upstream version is that the package itself
and several of its files have been renamed to from `mpack` to `mlapack`
to circumvent conflicts with other packages names `mpack`. In particular,
the `mpack` project name is not unique among Linux distributions. Most
Linux distributions already provide an `mpack` or `libmpack` package
that serves totally different purposes. The first provides tools for
encoding/decoding MIME messages and the second is a small binary
serialization/RPC library.


## Description

The MPACK is a multiprecision linear algebra package based on BLAS and LAPACK.
This package is rewritten in C++, and supports several high precision
libraries like GMP, MPFR and QD etc so that users can choose for user's
convenience. The MPACK is a free software (2-clause BSD style license with
original license by LAPACK).
